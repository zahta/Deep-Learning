### :paperclip:  Beginner's Guides
  - Some beginner's guides can be found in [my Machine learning Repository](https://github.com/zata213/path2ml).

### :pencil2: PyTorch
  - **[PyTorch Installation](https://pytorch.org/)**
    -  **Python and CPU version of PyTorch on windows, using conda:**
       - Create a new environment by `conda create --name pytorch`.
       - Activate the new environment by `conda activate pytorch`.
       - Install Python by `conda install python -y`.
       - Install Jupyter lab by `conda install jupyterlab -y`.
       - Install some required packages, e.g., numpy by `conda install numpy -y`.
       - Run the install command `conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch`.
       
    - **Verify The PyTorch Installation from Jupyter lab:**
       - To use PyTorch, type `import torch`: If you encounter with the error `[WinError 126] The specified module could not be found`, the [installation of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) will likely solve the problem.
       - To check the version, type `torch.__version__`.
       
 ### :pencil2: TensorFlow
   - **[TensorFlow Installation using conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/)**
     - Install the current release of CPU-only TensorFlow by `conda create -n tf tensorflow`.
     - Install Jupyter lab by `conda install jupyterlab -y`.
     - Install some required packages, e.g., numpy by `conda install numpy -y`.
  
   - **Verify The TensorFlow Installation from Jupyter lab:**
     - To use TensorFlow, type `import tensorflow`.
     - To check the version, type `tensorflow.__version__`.
