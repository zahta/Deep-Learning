# Deep Learning

:bulb: **The best way to predict the future is to create it. `Alan Kay`**   
 
In this repository, I have written some of my experiences in studying deep learning. Also, I have included some good resources and some of my exercises and educational projects. Furthermore, some good references about graph neural networks (GNNs) have been added.
